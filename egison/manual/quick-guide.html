<h1>Demonstration</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
  Egison is good at pattern matching for data types whose data have no normal form.<br/>
  We will demonstrate programs that execute pattern matching for collections, such as lists, multisets, and sets.<br/>
  Run them on your machine and feel how Egison is like!!<br/>
<hr/>

<h2 id="run-interpreter">Run Interpreter!!</h2>

<p>
  After you have installed Egison, you can run Egison interpreter with a command 'egison'. (<a href="./setting-up-egison.html">Setting up Egison!!</a>)<br/>
  Type Control-D to terminate the interpreter.
</p>
<pre>
  <code>

  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Give some input to Egison as below.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (define $x 2)
x
&gt; (test (+ x 3))
5
&gt; (define $f (lambda [$x $y] [(+ x y) (* x y)]))
f
&gt; (test (f x 4))
[6 8]
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  There are two kinds of <i>top expressions</i> in above input, <code>define</code> expressions and <code>test</code> expressions.<br/>
  A <code>define</code> expression binds the value or the function to the variable.<br/>
  A <code>test</code> expression evaluates the given expression.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="pattern-matching">Let's do Pattern Matching!!</h2>

<p>
  Let's run codes that do pattern matching!<br/>
  In this section, we will demonstrate codes that do pattern matching for collections.<br/>
  These codes will be good examples to know the characteristics of Egison.<br/>
  To run programs in this section, we need to load "<code>lib/base.egi</code>", "<code>lib/number.egi</code>" and "<code>lib/collection.egi</code>", at first.<br/>
  A <code>load</code> expression is one of the top expressions.<br/>
  It is used to load an Egison library, specified by the first argument.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (load "lib/base.egi")
&gt; (load "lib/number.egi")
&gt; (load "lib/collection.egi")
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  To load your own program, you can use <code>load-file</code> expressions.<br/>
  A <code>load-file</code> expression takes a full-path to the Egison program file.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Now, let's execute the following code.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3 4} (List Integer)
          [&lt;cons $x $xs&gt; [x xs]]))

{[1 {2 3 4}]}


&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3 4} (Multiset Integer)
          [&lt;cons $x $xs&gt; [x xs]]))

{[1 {2 3 4}] [2 {1 3 4}] [3 {1 2 4}] [4 {1 2 3}]}


&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3 4} (Set Integer)
          [&lt;cons $x $xs&gt; [x xs]]))

{[1 {2 3 4}] [2 {1 3 4}] [3 {1 2 4}] [4 {1 2 3}]
 [1 {2 3 4 1}] [2 {1 3 4 2}] [3 {1 2 4 3}] [4 {1 2 3 4}]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  A <code>match-all</code> expression takes a target expression, a type expression, and a single match-clause.<br/>
  Pattern matching of Egison has multiple results because unfree data has many forms.<br/>
  The body of a match-clause is evaluated for each result of pattern matching.<br/>
  In above example, the match-clause is "<code>[&lt;cons $x $xs&gt; [x xs]]</code>", and the body of the match-clause is "<code>{[x xs]}</code>".<br/>
  A <code>match-all</code> expression returns a collection which consists of all of those evaluated values.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  There are four kinds of parentheses in Egison.<br/>
  Here is brief explanation.<br/>
  An expression enclosed with '<code>(</code>' and '<code>{</code>' represent a procedure call or an application of syntax.<br/>
  An expression enclosed with '<code>&lt;</code>' and '<code>&gt;</code>' is used to construct an inductive data.<br/>
  An expression enclosed with '<code>[</code>' and '<code>]</code>' represent a tuple.<br/>
  An expression enclosed with '<code>{</code>' and '<code>}</code>' represent a collection.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  The meaning of <code>cons</code> is similar to that of the ordinary functional programming languages for lists.<br/>
  The meaning of a pattern constructor depends on types specified by second argument of the <code>match-all</code> expression.<br/>
  It divides a collection into an element and the rest of the collection.<br/>
  In case of multisets, an element bound to the first argument can be any elements in the target since the order of elements is not considered.<br/>
  In the third example, the target is matched as a set of integers where the order of elements and the multiple occurrence of elements are both ignored.<br/>
  Therefore the result of pattern matching consists of many elements.<br/>
  In case of sets, different from multisets, sets ignore the multiple occurrence of the same element.<br/>
  Therefore a element bound to <code>$x</code> can be contained to the collection bound to <code>$xs</code>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Here are other examples.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (List Integer)
          [&lt;join $xs $ys&gt; [xs ys]]))

{[{} {1 2 3}] [{1} {2 3}] [{1 2} {3}] [{1 2 3} {}]}


&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (Multiset Integer)
          [&lt;join $xs $ys&gt; [xs ys]]))

{[{} {1 2 3}] [{3} {1 2}] [{2} {1 3}] [{2 3} {1}]
 [{1} {2 3}] [{1 3} {2}] [{1 2} {3}] [{1 2 3} {}]}


&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (Set Integer)
          [&lt;join $xs $ys&gt; [xs ys]]))

{[{} {1 2 3}] [{3} {1 2}] [{3} {1 2 3}] [{2} {1 3}] [{2} {1 3 2}]
 ... [{1 2 3} {1 2 3}]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  There is another pattern constructor <code>join</code>.<br/>
  It takes two arguments.<br/>
  Programmers use it to divide a collection into two collections.<br/>
  A target matches to the pattern when the target collection is the union of the collection matched with both arguments of <code>join</code>.<br/>
  The meaning of union differs from type to type.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  The list data type has special pattern constructors, <code>snoc</code> and <code>nioj</code>.
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (List Integer)
          [&lt;snoc $x $xs&gt; [x xs]]))

{[4 {1 2 3}]}

      
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (List Integer)
          [&lt;nioj $xs $ys&gt; [xs ys]]))

{[{} {1 2 3}] [{3} {1 2}] [{2 3} {1}] [{1 2 3} {}]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Arguments of <code>snoc</code> matches with the last element of a target collection and the rest of it.<br/>
  In Egison, extraction of an element from the tail of a collection is represented in the same way with the head of it.<br/>
  A pattern constructor <code>nioj</code> is similar with <code>join</code>, and used to divide a target collection into two collections.<br/>
  The difference is the order of pattern matching.<br/>
  In case of <code>nioj</code>, pattern matching is executed from the back-side of a collection.<br/>
  The order of pattern matching is significant if we consider non-linear pattern matching, which we will discuss in the next section.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="non-linear-patterns">Non-linear Patterns</h2>

<p>
  With Egisonï¼Œprogrammers can match for a pattern that has repeated varibles.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3 1 2} (Multiset Integer)
          [&lt;cons $n &lt;cons ,n _&gt;&gt; n]))

{1 2}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The output of this example is a collection of numbers which are contained in the target collection more than twice.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  In Egison, pattern matching is executed from the left side of the pattern,
  and the value bound to a pattern variable can be referd in its right side of the pattern.<br/>
  A pattern which has '<code>,</code>' at the head is called a <i>value pattern</i>.<br/>
  If the value of the expression after '<code>,</code>' is equivalent to the target value when they are regarded as the type specified, pattern matching succeed.<br/>
  In this case, when the matching process proceeds to the pattern <code>,n</code>,
  the expression <code>n</code> is evaluated to the value to which <code>$n</code> is bound.<br/>
  The pattern <code>,n</code> is matched as an integer, so if the target value is equal to the value bound to <code>$n</code> as an integer,
  the pattern matching succeeds.<br/>
  '<code>_</code>' is a <i>wild card</i> which matches with any values.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Here is another example.
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {{1 2 3 4 5} {4 5 1} {6 1 7 4}} (List (Multiset Integer))
          [&lt;cons &lt;cons $n _&gt; &lt;cons &lt;cons ,n _&gt; &lt;cons &lt;cons ,n _&gt; &lt;nil&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; n]))

{1 4}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  With Egison, we are able to do pattern matching with nested data types easily.<br/>
  The target value is a collection of collections of integers.<br/>
  It is matched as a list of multisets of integers.<br/>
  This pattern extracts an element from each collection, which is an element of the target collection.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="cut-patterns">Cut Patterns</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match {2 7 7 2 7} (Multiset Integer)
          {[&lt;cons $m &lt;cons ,m &lt;cons ,m
             &lt;cons $n !&lt;cons ,n !&lt;nil&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
            &lt;ok&gt;]
           [_ &lt;ko&gt;]}))

&lt;ok&gt;
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Egison also has <code>match</code> expressions.<br/>
  A <code>match</code> expression takes a collection of match clauses.<br/>
  Matching process is executed from the top of the match clauses.<br/>
  The body of first succeeded match clause is evalated.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  The pattern of the first match clause matches if the target value is collection which contains three same number and other two same number.<br/>
  The target matches with the pattern of the first match clause, so the return value is <code><ok></code>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  A pattern which has '<code>!</code>' at the head is called a <i>cut pattern</i>.<br/>
  If there are several matchings to the point of the cut pattern, one of them are taken and pattern matching for the rest of the pattern is executed.<br/>
  If pattern matching after the position of the cut pattern fails, backtracking before the position of the cut pattern is not executed.<br/>
  Cut patterns are used to avoid unnecessary search.<br/>
  In the above case, since there is only one combination that three same number appears among the collection which has five elements,<br/>
  further search is not required if pattern matching failed after a triple of three same number is found.<br/>
  This cut pattern represent this fact.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  If pattern matching after the cut pattern succeed, backtracking before the position of the cut pattern is executed as there is no cut pattern.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3} (Multiset Integer)
          [&lt;cons $x &lt;cons $y &lt;cons $z !&lt;nil&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [x y z]]))

{[1 2 3] [1 3 2] [2 1 3] [2 3 1] [3 1 2] [3 2 1]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The cut pattern is especially useful for pattern matching with multisets.<br/>
  The power of cut patterns is demonstrated with the code that determines poker hands.
  (<a href="./poker-hands.html">Example1. Poker Hands</a>)<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="loop-patterns">Loop Patterns</h2>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (match-all {1 2 3 4} (List Integer)
          [&lt;join _ &lt;cons $m &lt;join _ &lt;cons $n _&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [m n]]))

{[1 2] [1 3] [1 4] [2 3] [2 4] [3 4]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The output of the above expression is all combinations of two elements from the target collection.<br/>
  The output consists of <i>nC2</i> elements where <code>n</code> is the length of the target collection.<br/>
  The first '<code>_</code>' matches with some front part of the target collection,<br/>
  and <code>$m</code> matches with the element behind it.<br/>
  The second '<code>_</code>' matches with some subcollection that follows after the element bound to <code>\$m</code>,<br/>
  and <code>$n</code> matches with the element behind it.<br/>
  The last '<code>_</code>' matches with the rest of collection.<br/>
  For example, the case <code>$m</code> bound to <code>1</code> and <code>$n</code> bound to <code>2</code>,<br/>
  the first and the second '<code>_</code>' matches with empty collection,<br/>
  and the last '<code>_</code>' matches with the collection <code>{3 4}</code>.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  The pattern which generates <i>nCk</i> combinations of elements can be written for any fixed <i>k</i> in the same way.<br/>
  However, it is not possible to write a pattern for dynamically changing <i>k</i> in the same way.<br/>
  This is because we cannot write patterns including a parameter that determines the count of pattern variables in them.<br/>
  Egison has the special pattern syntax, <code>loop</code> expressions and <i>subscripted variables</i> to enable it.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  A variable whose name contains `_' and an expression which returns integer in its tail is called a subscripted variable.<br/>
  It is similar to an array of other programming languages.<br/>
  A difference is it can be used in patterns as a pattern variable.<br/>
  We can append several subscritions to one variable.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  A <code>loop</code> expression takes a <i>loop variable</i>, a <i>index variable</i>, a <i>range expression</i>, a <i>middle expression</i>, and a <i>tail expression</i>.<br/>
  A range expression returns a index collection.<br/>
  The index variable runs through its elements.<br/>
  A <code>loop</code> expression is expanded to the middle expression when it has one and more elements.<br/>
  When there are no elements, a <code>loop</code> expression is expanded to the tail expression.<br/>
  The loop variable in the middle expression is expanded to the next middle expression when there is the next element in the index collection.<br/>
  If there is no unused element in the index collection, the loop variable in the middle expression is expanded to the tail expression.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (define $combination
    (lambda [$xs $k]
      (match-all xs (List Something)
        [(loop $l $i (between 1 k) &lt;join _ &lt;cons $a_i l&gt;&gt; _)
         [@(loop $l $i (between 1 k) {a_i @l} {})]])))

&gt; (test (combination {1 2 3 4} 3))

{[1 2 3] [1 2 4] [1 3 4][2 3 4]}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  <code>between</code> is a function which take two arguments and return a sequence of numbers between them.<br/>
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
&gt; (test (between 2 4))

{2 3 4}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  With a loop pattern, we can represent patterns for Hamilton path or cycle of graphs in a single pattern.
